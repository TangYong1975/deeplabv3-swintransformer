# deeplabv3-swintransformer

from deeplabv3 (https://github.com/VainF/DeepLabV3Plus-Pytorch), and some swin-transformers (https://github.com/berniwal/swin-transformer-pytorch„ÄÅhttps://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer), I try these swin-transformers as backbone on deeplabv3, to see image segmentation and compare them.

thanks.
